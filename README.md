This repository contains the source files for the paper "Move Schedules: fast persistence computations in coarse dynamic settings. 

For the accompanying code and materials used to perform the experiments, [this R package](https://github.com/peekxc/dart) contains some of the earlier experimental work with 2-parameter persistence and [this python package](https://github.com/peekxc/dart) contains code to reproduce the scheduling code. 

The code is primarily given for transparency. For more specific issues regarding package usage, please file an issue.
