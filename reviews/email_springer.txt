Dear Dr. Matthew Piekenbrock,
Thank you for your email.
We do not pass on reports of previously conducted peer review to the next journal. In case you would like the next journal to have a look at the review reports, you can include them as supplementary material while finalizing your submission in the next journal. If you have any queries on concerns you may contact the journal directly.

Best  regards,

I have submitted our work to the Journal of Applied and Computational Topology using the Snapp system. 

There was no option to "transfer" anything (e.g. the reviews from the prior submission) to this submission. I did follow the link provided to submit the manuscript, however. Is this aspect handled on Springer's end?

Dear Dr. Matthew Piekenbrock,
​
​
Thank you for confirming that you would like to transfer your manuscript to Journal of Applied and Computational Topology.

In order to improve the entire submission and publishing experience at Springer Nature, we are developing a new submission system, Snapp. As part of this process, we have started to migrate a number of journals to this new platform, and Journal of Applied and Computational Topology is one of the early adopters. As a result of the change in systems, however, we are currently unable to transfer your manuscript automatically.

Instead, we encourage you to submit your manuscript directly by using the following link: Submit Manuscript

Snapp is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive author experience, and for Journal of Applied and Computational Topology this has resulted in improved turnaround times from submission to acceptance. Nevertheless, should you have any problems submitting your manuscript using the above link, please let me know and I will be happy to help.

Thank you for using the Transfer Desk; I wish you every success with your manuscript. If you have time to answer a few questions to help us improve this service, please click here to complete our survey
